    <br>
     <p class="paragraph"> Additionally, I am obsessed with self-improvement. Growth is an endlessly iterative process.
       </p>
       <p class="paragraph"> I am constantly acknowledging my own ignorance and the constant doubt in my own beliefs in order to not only learn more but learn right.
        A simple maxim I wake up to: What should I learn today?
     </p>
    <br>
     <p class="paragraph">I will use this website to publish personal projects as grow more adept in skill and knowledge in computer science and practical programming.
